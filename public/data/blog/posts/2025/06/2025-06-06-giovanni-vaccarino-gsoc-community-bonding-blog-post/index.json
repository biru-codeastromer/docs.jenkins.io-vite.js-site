This summer, I’ll be working on building an <strong>AI-Powered Chatbot for Quick Access to Jenkins Resources</strong>, a project aimed at creating a Jenkins plugin that integrates an AI chatbot that helps users to quickly find relevant Jenkins documentation, plugins, and other community resources.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"kicking-off-the-journey\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#kicking-off-the-journey\"></a>Kicking Off the Journey</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Just a day after the official GSoC announcements, we had a warm welcome session with all Jenkins mentors and mentees. We had the opportunity to introduce ourselves and break the ice. Seeing how dedicated the other mentees are to their projects and how supportive the community it has been fantastic.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A few days after, I had my first dedicated project meeting, where I got to connect with my mentors. That’s when things started moving fast as my mentors proposed to start coding immediately, with the idea of delivering an MVP by the start of the coding period.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"project-description\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-description\"></a>Project Description</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The project aims to support the Jenkins users by providing an intuitive, conversational assistant embedded directly into the Jenkins UI, via a plugin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It will use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to search through official documentation, Discourse threads, and StackOverflow posts. The backend will be powered by a locally hosted quantized LLM served via FastAPI, while the frontend, built with React and TypeScript, will provide a modern and quick-access to the assistant.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"community-bonding-period-works\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#community-bonding-period-works\"></a>Community Bonding Period Works</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Joined onboarding and introductory call with Jenkins GSoC mentors and org admins.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attended a couple of meetings with mentors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintained a daily diary document to track my tasks, considerations, and questions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set up the development environment, forking the plugin repository.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Worked on the RAG pipeline, initial user interface, and API integration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Opened and merged:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/1\">#1</a> (data collection),\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/3\">#3</a> (data preprocessing),\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/6\">#6</a> (chunking),\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/8\">#8</a> (standardized logging).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Opened (under review):\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/7\">#7</a> (user interface),\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/9\">#9</a> (embedding & storage),\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/pull/10\">#10</a> (API integration).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Performed additional research to maximize RAG performance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"what-ive-learned-so-far\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-ive-learned-so-far\"></a>What I've Learned So Far</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first few weeks taught me a lot about working in a production-scale environment.

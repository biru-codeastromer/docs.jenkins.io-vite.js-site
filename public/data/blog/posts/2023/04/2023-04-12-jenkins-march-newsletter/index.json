keys.\nRefer to the Jenkins <a href=\"/blog/2023/03/27/repository-signing-keys-changing/\">blog post</a> for more details.\nThe Jenkins installer for Windows and the Jenkins WAR file have also been signed with a new code signing certificate issued by DigiCert.\nThanks to the Continuous Delivery Foundation for their help with the new code signing certificate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Chinese translation of the Jenkins documentation has been unmaintained for almost two years.\nRather than risk confusing Chinese users that are following outdated instructions, we've removed the link to the outdated Chinese site.\nWe invite Chinese users to use the English language documentation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"/press/\">Jenkins press contacts</a> have been simplified, to invite members of the press with questions about Jenkins to post their questions to the <a href=\"https://community.jenkins.io/c/press/24\">press category</a> on community.jenkins.io.\nSpecial thanks to <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/\">Discourse</a> for hosting the Jenkins community site.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins board, members of the Jenkins security team, and several others were involved in resolving an incorrect claim against a repository of the Jenkins GitHub organization.\nThe claim incorrectly asserted that one of the Jenkins GitHub repositories had published private information, copyrighted material, or a password without consent.\nThe issue was resolved through the efforts of Daniel Beck, the company that filed the incorrect report, and the maintainers of the affected plugins.\nThanks to all involved for resolving the issue.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"security-fixes\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2023/01/12/jenkins-newsletter/security.png\" alt=\"Security

class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the course of March, the Jenkins infrastructure team has worked to provide several enhancements and updates including:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Huge effort on bandwidth reduction for dependencies from JFrog, by switching almost all workloads to the new artifact caching proxy, with a focus on developer UX to allow disabling it when unreliable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of the controller Azure credentials are managed as code, opening the door for safer identity management.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved safety and reliability for the releases of both weekly and Jenkins Core, by migrating this process into a new private Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 3.9.0 and 3.9.1 were rolled-out to developers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Ubuntu 22.04 upgrade campaign has been planned and started.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A new GPG key rolled-out for signing Jenkins repositories and Core artifacts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usual maintenance efforts to keep the infrastructure running, including weekly dependency upgrades, support for the 2 security advisories, and migrating pipelines from GitHub actions to our own Jenkins private instances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"modern-ui\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

href=\"https://github.com/janfaracik\">Jan Faracik</a> and the many reviewers involved in the improvements.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The plugin:pipeline-graph-view/[Pipeline graph view plugin] continues to evolve and improve as a Pipeline visualization replacement for Blue Ocean.\nIt now includes progressive viewing of log files.\nThanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/timbrown5\">Tim Brown</a> for the improvements.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/manage/about/\">\"About Jenkins\"</a> page in Jenkins weekly releases now includes a <a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43062514/224480863-9e8e893a-c78a-4511-98c3-b672bedef80a.png\">new image</a> and an invitation to \"get involved\" with the Jenkins project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7718\">Jenkins icon legend</a> is now a modal dialog in Jenkins weekly releases.\nThe modal dialog does not move the user away from the current page.\nExpect to see more modal dialogs in Jenkins in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>More Jenkins messages have been translated into Turkish thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mustafau\">Mustafa Ulu</a>.\nThey have been released in Jenkins weekly releases in March.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Support for <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7299\">user experimental flags</a> (\"feature flags\") has been added to Jenkins core.\nDevelopers can deliver new features and allow users to enable or disable those features for their own account.\nThanks to Wadeck Follonier for the implementation and thanks to all those who reviewed and helped with the pull request.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"documentation\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the course of March, there were 7 blog posts published, featuring several different authors.\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/gounthar/\">Bruno Verachten</a> has shared his experiences using Jenkins in intriguing ways, as well as starting a new series of posts regarding Android and Jenkins.\nWe also crossed into triple digits (101) for the number of pull requests merged this month for jenkins.io alone.\nAlong with recent UI updates, the Jenkins documentation is being updated to reflect the simplified Manage Jenkins settings names.\nThanks to all of the continuing and new contributors, all of your work helps support both the Jenkins project and the Open-Source community.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"platform\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nothing has to be done for Jenkins Docker installation, because the key is not required for container installations, as we manage the service ourselves in the

author:dduportal[Damien Duportal]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Following FOSDEM, where most of the infrastructure team was present physically, February was a busy month for the Jenkins Infrastructure team:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In an effort to reduce bandwidth with JFrog (repo.jenkins-ci.org), Jenkins continuous integration jobs are now using significantly less internet bandwidth thanks to the artifact caching proxy implemented by the team.\nThe artifact caching proxy is implemented on our three cloud providers, so that artifacts can be downloaded from a local cache rather than accessing the artifact repository.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Jenkins LTS <code>2.375.3</code> is now used on all of our controllers, less than 3 days after its release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have removed all Jenkins deprecated plugins on all of our controllers such as jquery, momentjs, and ace-editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We upgraded all six of our Kubernetes clusters from the <code>1.23</code> to <code>1.24</code> baseline in the three cloud providers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of the private and internal web services are now using TLS with certificates provided by Let's Encrypt, along with Azure DNS challenge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We contributed to Docker documentation after catching issues with the Docker CE <code>23.x</code> fresh release and Docker BuildX on Ubuntu.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div id=\"documentation\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

resolved several action items, and noted the progress on projects with sponsors like JFrog and Atlassian.\nWe're sincerely grateful for the sponsorships provided by those generous companies and many other companies.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"platform\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2023/01/12/jenkins-newsletter/platform-modernization.png\"

ongoing work, we are considering CentOS 7 and its eventual end of life.\nThere is a proposal to deprecate the Centos <code>7</code> Jenkins controller Docker images.\nWhen we decide to deprecate these images, we'll publish an announcement and a <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep\">JEP</a>.\nBefore it is fully deprecated, we'll also release a merged version of the <code>centos</code> and <code>centos7</code> image as the very last CentOS <code>7</code> Docker image.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In regards to our Docker images, there were several updates here as well:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The latest updates are now part of the agent images such as:</p>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ssh-agent: Upgraded Git version on

out, so that we describe the use and installation of Jenkins with openJDK17.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>New platforms:</p>\n</div>\n<div

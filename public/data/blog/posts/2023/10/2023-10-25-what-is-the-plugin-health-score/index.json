class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This project started during the Google Summer of Code 2022 and was finished during the Google Summer of Code 2023.\nWe created the Plugin Health Scoring project with and for the Jenkins community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The purpose of the project is to provide an unbiased score to all plugins.\nThe resulting score is based on data retrieved from each plugin, and this data is analyzed the same way for every plugin.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-scores\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#understanding-the-scores\"></a>Understanding the scores</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The scores are based on several data points gathered from each plugin.\nWe use the <code>update-center.json</code> to populate the list of plugins and their source code location.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Based on that, we run what we call <code>probes</code> on each plugin.\nThe purpose of these probes is strictly to gather data such as:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Is there a <code>Jenkinsfile</code> within the plugin repository?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When was the last commit on the default branch of the repository?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/probes\">the list of probes</a> used in the project, and you can find their source code <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes\">in their repository</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Once the data is gathered, we run a list of <em>scoring</em> processes, which grade all plugins based only on the available data.\nAll plugins are then scored using the same criteria.\nYou can find the list of <em>scoring</em> processes <a href=\"https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/scores\">on the Plugin Health Score site</a> and their implementation <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores\">in the Plugin Health Score repository</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Refer to the Plugin Health Scoring project <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.adoc\">documentation</a> for further information about the architecture and behavior of the project.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"how-is-it-displayed\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#how-is-it-displayed\"></a>How is it displayed?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The score of every plugin is fetched when the plugin site is built.\nThat data is then used to build the <code>/&lt;plugin-name&gt;/healthscore/</code> page, using the component <code>PluginHealthScore</code>.\nThat component can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site/blob/master/plugins/plugin-site/src/components/PluginHealthScore.jsx\">the plugin site repository</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The scores and different categories are dynamic, and are coming directly from the Plugin Health Scoring project.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"disclaimer\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#disclaimer\"></a>Disclaimer</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The scores are not perfect and are just another indicator of the plugin state.\nWe are still working on using more data from the plugin to contribute to the score.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The grading system that generates the score for each plugin is, I believe, subjective.\nHowever, it is not written in stone and can, and most likely will, evolve in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you feel there is something incorrect about a plugin score, this may indicate a false negative.\nPlease raise an issue on the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug-report.yaml\">Plugin Health Scoring project</a> if the score does not appear to be accurate.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"links\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#links\"></a>Links</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div

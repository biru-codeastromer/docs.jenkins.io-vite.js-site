on Maven production files (<code>pom.xml</code> and <code>src/main</code> folder).\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is my first probe that went live as a GSoC contributor.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"importance-of-the-probe\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#importance-of-the-probe\"></a>Importance of the probe</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The probe aims to identify unreleased production commits in  Maven production files.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Finding an unreleased production file can mean one or more of the following:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>There are unreleased security fixes that should be released as soon as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are unreleased features requested that would improve the usefulness of the plugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The plugin maintainer may be inactive or too busy to further develop the plugin.\nThis could indicate the plugin needs a new maintainer and should be up for adoption.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"challenges\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#challenges\"></a>Challenges</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Learning to use <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/\">JGit</a>, a Java library that implements a Git version control system, was one of the biggest challenges I faced when working on this probe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since I was not familiar with Git hierarchy, I struggled to find the parent of a child commit using JGit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the end, my mentors suggested a pair programming session to review the thinking process involved in implementing such a probe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I am thankful for their kindness and patience.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"outcome\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#outcome\"></a>Outcome</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When unreleased production files are found, the probe returns a failure status and the list of filenames.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When no unreleased production file is found, the probe returns a success message.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"learning\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#learning\"></a>Learning</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I hope there comes a day when test cases become my friends, but I don't see this happening anytime soon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mentors suggested I should start with writing the test cases to reproduce the probe requirement(s), and later add code to pass each of the test cases.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This gave me an understanding of what the probe should actually do, and I learned to identify the test case scenarios.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Reading commits wasn't possible without JGit Java library.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To implement JGit library and understand the features it provides, you should have strong understanding of Git concepts.\nI lacked depth in Git concepts that made me struggle with JGit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This led me to strengthen the Git concepts along the way.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I once again realised the open-source world values quality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The community is fine with fewer \"quality\" probes, as opposed to many \"not-so-useful\" probes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Starting from ground zero is tough, whether implementing a new Java library or starting new work in another field.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, with correct mentorship and guidance, you can rise up faster.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"links\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#links\"></a>Links</h2>\n<div

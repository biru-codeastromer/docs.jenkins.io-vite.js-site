contributor who will be working on the exciting project of \"Building jenkins.io with alternative tools\".\nI am genuinely excited to join this vibrant community and contribute to the development of Jenkins, a widely adopted and powerful automation server.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"project-descriptionmotivation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-descriptionmotivation\"></a>Project Description/Motivation:</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The project I will be working on aims to generate the existing Jenkins.io website using alternative tools like Antora and Gatsby.\nThe primary goal of this project is to make the Jenkins user documentation Product Version Bound.\nBoth tools are used for site generation however we will be using Antora for most parts of the site as its best fits our current needs.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"introduction\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#introduction\"></a>Introduction:</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Let me take a moment to introduce myself.\nMy name is Vandit Singh, and I am an aspiring software developer from India with a passion for automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices.\nI have a strong interest in Java, DevOps and Web, and I am eager to leverage my skills to have a fruitful summer under Google Summer of Code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have realized the tremendous potential of automation in streamlining software development processes.\nMy exposure to Jenkins, both as a user and an admirer of its capabilities, has inspired me to become an active contributor to its growth and evolution.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"plans-for-the-near-future\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#plans-for-the-near-future\"></a>Plans for the Near Future:</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As I embark on this GSoC journey, I have laid out some plans for the initial phase of the project before the mid-term evaluations.\nFirstly, I will focus on developing a prototype of jenkins.io with Antora with Versioned User Documentation.\nAfter that developer documentation will be non-versioned and at last blogs will be generated with Gatsby.\nFor more details, you can refer to the\n<a href=\"/projects/gsoc/2023/projects/alternative-jenkinsio-build-tool/\">project page</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In parallel, I will collaborate with the Jenkins community to gather feedback and suggestions on the existing Jenkins.io structure.\nBy understanding the needs and pain points of the community, I aim to enhance the user experience and ensure that the alternative tools project aligns seamlessly with the existing content and architecture and enhances UI/UX in some way.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"technical-details\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#technical-details\"></a>Technical Details:</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>From a technical perspective, my work will involve tools that are used to generate static sites.\nThis may include solutions like\n<a href=\"https://antora.org/\">Antora</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a>,\nwith a focus on maintaining the current theme and layout.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Throughout the GSoC period, I am eager to collaborate with the Jenkins community, engage in discussions, and learn from the experienced members who have been instrumental in shaping Jenkins into the remarkable tool it is today.\nI genuinely believe that this project will be a collective effort, and I am excited to collaborate and contribute in a meaningful way.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"in-closing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#in-closing\"></a>In Closing:</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div

to be part of a community that fosters innovation and promotes open-source collaboration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I am filled with a sense of enthusiasm and anticipation as I dive into the project and get to know the community better.\nTogether, we can unlock new possibilities and ensure that Jenkins remains at the forefront of continuous integration and

href=\"https://fosdem.org/2023/about/\">FOSDEM</a>!\nOn February 4 & 5, contributors from the Jenkins project and thousands of other open-source enthusiasts traveled from around the world to flock to FOSDEM.\nLocated in Brussels, Belgium, FOSDEM is an opportunity to renew relationships, forge new bonds, and share the incredible work that is being advanced by the open-source ecosystem.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2023/02/21/2023-02-21-thoughts-on-FOSDEM-2023/image7.png\" alt=\"Brussels at night.\"

on partnerships between our communities.\nOne Oreboot member soldered an SPI chip on my RISC-V Jenkins agent (in a corridor, using a chair as a workbench) to free it from U-Boot.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>There are two things I'd like to point out:\n* People love Jenkins, lots of them came to the booth to testify.\n* Open source is not just a GitHub punchcard, it's way more about sharing knowledge and empowering people.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Bruno Verachten\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a

view.\nTo be able to meet in real life the people whom we discuss and work every day for Jenkins, (Oleg, Alexander, …) is a real pleasure.\nHearing testimonials from Jenkins users about their love of Jenkins and the particular uses they have for it has also done us a lot of good.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Stéphane Merle\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a

Jenkins, which really helped to broaden my understanding of the platform and how it is being used in the real world.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Alexander

with great pleasure that I could attend this incredible event.\nMeeting contributors and members of the community in person was such a change after these years hiding from the pandemic.\nI particularly enjoyed the great conversations on so many subjects such as the Jenkins day to day experience, where the project is heading (or should head to), and particularly, my personal pet interests: <a href=\"/projects/gsoc/\">GSoC</a> or how to start contributing.\nEven after attending this conference since 2009, my amazement never fades for this incredible explosion of ideas, enthusiasm, diversity, dedication, and generosity for the Open Source movement.\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Jean-Marc Meessen\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Many

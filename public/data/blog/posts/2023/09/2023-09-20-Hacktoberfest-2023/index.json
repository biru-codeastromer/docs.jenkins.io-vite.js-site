class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Once again, <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com\">Hacktoberfest</a> is back!\nDuring this October event, everyone can celebrate and support open source by contributing changes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year's edition is special because it is Hacktoberfest's tenth anniversary.\nOnce again, the Jenkins community will participate in the event, and we invite you to contribute to Jenkins projects.\nWe also encourage maintainers to welcome and help newcomers in the project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The event is a good opportunity to cross the \"imposter syndrome\" threshold and contribute back to Open Source.\nA lot of helpful folks will be available to guide less experienced contributors in their first steps.\nIt is also a great opportunity to acquire and exercise new skills, both hard and soft, while improving your experience with CI/CD in general and Jenkins in particular.\nOn top of this, it is a great way to \"build the Jenkins dev muscle\", should one want to be part of the Jenkins Google Summer of Code 2024 adventure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>September is the perfect time to prepare for Hacktoberfest.\nGet a jump start by finding projects to contribute to, adding the \"Hacktoberfest\" tag to your projects, or familiarizing yourself with Git.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Due to the increasing popularity of Hacktoberfest, and to ensure its sustainability for another decade, the organization is <a

complete Hacktoberfest:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Register anytime between September 26 and October 31 on the <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/\">Hacktoberfest site</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pull requests can be made in any <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/repositories?q=hacktoberfest\">jenkinsci</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/repositories?q=hacktoberfest\">jenkins-infra</a> GitHub project that is participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the \"hacktoberfest\" topic).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Project maintainers must accept your pull requests for them to count toward your total.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The new digital reward kit will include a customizable badge that evolves with each pull request accepted by maintainers, representing the participant's journey in open source and Hacktoberfest.\nAdditionally, participants will receive unique badges featuring a delightful surprise and gifts from sponsors.\nParticipants will also be able to proudly share their badge on the Holopin Hacktoberfest Badge Board of Fame.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In previous years, Hacktoberfest sponsors have given participants who completed 4 PRs the option to plant a tree through Tree Nation, instead of receiving a t-shirt.\nThis year, a tree will be purchased for the first 50,000 participants that complete their first PR.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div

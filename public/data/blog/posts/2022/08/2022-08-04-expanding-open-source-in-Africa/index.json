delivery.\nOpen source operating systems dominate cloud computing operating systems.\nOpen source JavaScript libraries and frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, and React are key components in web applications.\nOpen source Java libraries and frameworks like Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Grails provide effective and powerful foundations for development.\nOpen source Java development tools like Apache Maven, Jenkins, and Visual Studio Code improve developer productivity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Open source software relies on open source contributors to maintain and improve it.\nUnfortunately, open source contributions are not evenly distributed throughout the world.\nAreas with more developed software organizations also tend to contribute more to open source software.\nWe&#8217;re working to increase open source contributions from Africa, one project at a time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"/blog/authors/zaycodes/\">Zainab Daodu</a>, Omotola Omotayo, and <a href=\"/blog/authors/markewaite/\">Mark Waite</a> will present \"Expanding open source in Africa\" at <a href=\"https://reg.devopsworld.com/flow/cloudbees/devopsworld22/landing/page/welcome\">DevOps World 2022</a>.\nJoin us on Thursday, September 29, 2022 in Orlando as we share our experiences and help you find ways that you can help expand open source in Africa.\nThe presentation will share what we&#8217;ve learned while running outreach efforts to help more African contributors work in open source.\nWe&#8217;ll include highlights from the Jenkins project involvement in She Code Africa Contributhon 2022.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"she-code-africa-contributhon-2022\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#she-code-africa-contributhon-2022\"></a>She Code Africa Contributhon 2022</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon\">She Code Africa Contributhon</a> is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.\nThis program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.\nThe 6 mentees joining the Jenkins project come from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The 2022 <a href=\"/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/#she-code-africa-contributhon\">Contributhon</a> brought 3 different projects to the Jenkins community:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#inclusive-naming\">Inclusive naming</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#screenshot-updates\">Screenshot updates</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"#pipeline-help\">Pipeline help</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>New contributors developed their skills by submitting GitHub pull requests and working with mentors to improve those pull requests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>She Code Africa also provided a <a href=\"#project-manager\">project manager</a> to oversee all the projects.\nThis was our first experience with a project manager for a She Code Africa project.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"inclusive-naming\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#inclusive-naming\"></a>Inclusive naming</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In 2016 the Jenkins project switched to use the term \"agent\" to describe worker nodes.\nInclusive naming changes were approved in 2020 to use the term \"controller\" for the central Jenkins process that orchestrates work on agents.\nAdditional naming changes include the use of \"allowlist\" and \"denylist\" rather than their less inclusive alternatives.\nThose inclusive naming changes have been moving through the Jenkins plugin code base, but there is plenty of work yet to do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Catherine Kiiru and Peace Okafor worked with the Jenkins project to identify source code locations where inclusive naming could be applied safely.\nThe <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iv2wW3GQinrZ408YZ_MwGEokWqZqv0p3Iycv6rmwhI/edit?usp=sharing\">inclusive naming planning sheet</a> guided their efforts and provides a reference for further inclusive naming improvements.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<div class=\"title\">Catherine Kiiru</div>\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins user interface has been significantly improved over the course of the past 18 months of development.\nHowever, the documentation screenshots had not been updated.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Somaa Chukwu worked with the Jenkins project to review the documentation screenshots and identified the outdated screenshots.\nShe used the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hudD8cK_ySs0r6wnZHf-GFqOaDFIHL3stvvXUbacXjY/edit#gid=0\">outdated screenshots</a> worksheet to submit pull requests.\nSomaa&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Asomaathetechster\">screenshot updates</a> helped the Jenkins project while she was

was continued by <a href=\"/blog/authors/kmartens27/\">Kevin Martens</a>.\nDocumentation screenshots are now current with the Jenkins 2.346.x LTS line.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"pipeline-help\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#pipeline-help\"></a>Pipeline help</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins <a href=\"/doc/pipeline/steps/\">Pipeline Steps Reference</a> and Pipeline online help often receive <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nA8xVOkyKmZ8oTYSLdwjborT0w-BpBNNZT0nxR9deZ8/edit#gid=1087292709\">feedback</a> that more examples are needed, that step return values need to be described, and that arguments need more description of their purpose, allowed values, and expected results.\nMost plugin maintainers do not provide detailed documentation of the pipeline steps, or the arguments to those pipeline steps.\nThe Pipeline help project improves the documentation of pipeline steps and their arguments while introducing Jenkins Pipeline, Jenkins plugin development, Jenkins documentation as code, and the concepts of GitHub forks and pull requests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We used the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AG437RU_ZLuhfbJJNj3ZSXllrFg_bYbru5x0rPq_u2c/edit?usp=sharing\">project plan</a> to guide the improvements to several plugins, including the git plugin, the

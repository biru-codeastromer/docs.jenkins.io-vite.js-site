href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/229/README.adoc\">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 229</a>.\nBy the end of 2021, 119 plugins had adopted continuous delivery, providing new plugin releases each time a relevant commit was merged to the plugin repository.\nAdditional components have adopted continuous delivery as well, including the plugin bill of materials and the Jenkins test harness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We look forward to even greater adoption of continuous delivery for plugins in 2022.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3

plugins.\nThe project is sincerely grateful to <a href=\"/blog/authors/daniel-beck/\">Daniel Beck</a> for his years of service as Jenkins Security Officer.\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/wadeck/\">Wadeck Follonier</a> began his service as Jenkins Security Officer in December, 2021.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins infrastructure team resolved infrastructure issues and safeguarded Jenkins infrastructure.\nThe project is deeply grateful to <a href=\"/blog/authors/olblak/\">Olivier Vernin</a> for his years of service as Jenkins Infrastructure Officer.\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/dduportal/\">Damien Duportal</a> began his service as Jenkins Infrastructure Officer in December, 2021.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"agent-to-controller-security\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#agent-to-controller-security\"></a>Agent to controller security</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Daniel Beck proposed <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/235\">Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 235</a> in November, 2021 to remove the ability to disable or customize the agent-to-controller security system.\nTelemetry has been added to Jenkins releases beginning with 2.319.1 and Jenkins 2.326.\nThe telemetry reports agent use of methods to access files on the controller.\nAs controller file access from agents is detected by the telemetry, issues are raised to remove that access from the offending plugin.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3

announcement of multiple zero day vulnerabilities in the Apache Log4j 2 library.\nThe Jenkins security team assessed the impact of the vulnerabilities and confirmed that Jenkins core was not affected by the vulnerabilities.\nFurther research showed that Jenkins plugins might be affected by the vulnerabilities.\nInstructions were <a href=\"/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/\">shared in a blogpost</a> so that Jenkins administrators could check their system for issues.\nA <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67353\">Jira epic</a> tracks the progress of corrections in the

href=\"#jenkins-confluence-instance-shutdown\"></a>Jenkins Confluence instance shutdown</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In September, 2021, a zero day vulnerability was disclosed in the Confluence version used in the Jenkins project.\nThe infrastructure team permanently disabled the service, rotated privileged credentials, and actively reduced the scope of access across the Jenkins infrastructure.\nPasswords for all user accounts on jenkins.io were reset.\nUsers were required to perform a password recovery in order to regain access to their jenkins.io accounts.\n See the <a href=\"/blog/2021/09/04/wiki-attacked/\">blogpost</a> for more details.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The page content from the Jenkins Confluence instance has been returned to service as

coordinated and mentored an end-of-study security research project for four students during the last year of their Master's Degree - Reliability and IT Security at the University of Aix-Marseille.\nThe students applied their university training to audit Jenkins core and many Jenkins plugins for specific types of security issues.\nTheir project resulted in 14 vulnerabilities reported in Jenkins security advisories.\nMore details of their results and their processes are available in the <a

This is typically the case when plugin requirements, e.g. a recent version of Jenkins, are not satisfied. If you are using the latest version of Jenkins offered to you, newer plugin releases may not be available to your release line yet. See the plugin documentation for information about its requirements.</em>\".</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2022-02-10-last-plugin-version-not-installable/plugin-not-installable.png\" alt=\"pluginView\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The message indicates to Jenkins administrators that a newer plugin version is available\nbut that the installed Jenkins core doesn&#8217;t provide a necessary prerequisite â€“ typically being too old.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><strong>Why is this happening now?</strong>\nDid I miss something?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As part of the continuous improvement of Jenkins, some critical and high impact changes are introduced.\nThis is typically the case of GUI changes (icons, fonts, layout) as is currently happening.\nIt is also the case for new core features that can be consumed by plugins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Such changes are typically first introduced in the cutting edge Jenkins weekly release.\nPlugins are adapted to take advantage of these changes and the minimal Jenkins version required for those new plugin releases is set to a very new release of Jenkins that includes these changes.\nThis causes a clear requirement disruption compared to the generally slow and low-impact plugin requirement evolution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It will require more time before these major changes will be available in an LTS Jenkins version.\nIn the meantime, the new plugin will have to wait before it can be installed on that release line.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you <em>need</em> to install that latest plugin version because it also fixes that annoying bug, you will have to evaluate whether it is worth <a href=\"/download/lts/#switching-from-lts-to-weekly\">switching to the weekly release line</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Note that this story is a strong reminder to keep your Jenkins system as current as possible if you don&#8217;t want to miss out on new features and important bug fixes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Special thanks to Daniel Beck to have given me the \"raw\" explanation of this unexpected behavior.</p>\n</div>"

We make sure that every project has at least two mentors.\nGSoC org admins will help to find technical advisers, so you can study together with your GSoC contributor.\nMentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).\nMentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading.\nThey review GSoC contributor proposals, pull-requests and contributor presentations at the evaluation phase.\nThey fill in the Google provided final evaluations at the end of the coding period.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"what-do-you-get-in-exchange\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-do-you-get-in-exchange\"></a>What do you get in exchange?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Mentor interaction is a vital part of GSoC.\nIn return for mentoring, a GSoC contributor works on your project full time for 10-22 weeks.\nThink about the projects that you’ve always wanted to do but never had the time…\nMentoring is also an opportunity to improve your management and people skills, while giving back to the community.\nGSoC is a fantastic program and the Jenkins project is looking forward to participating in GSoC again in 2023!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For any question, you can find the GSoC Org Admins, mentors and participants on the <a href=\"https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im\">GSoC SIG Gitter</a> chat.</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

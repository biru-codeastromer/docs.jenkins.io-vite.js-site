ideas, great work, new Jenkins contributors, and returning contributors.\nWe want to thank all of the contributors and mentors for all of their hard work, as none of this would be possible without them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com/\">Hacktoberfest</a> is an event to highlight and celebrate open-source projects like Jenkins.\nThe main idea of the event is contributing to and improving open-source software.\nPeople are invited to submit pull requests and engage with open-source software in a variety of ways, such as contributing to plugins, creating documentation, providing localization, and reviewing code.\nMany products and services are based on open-source software, so giving back in this way continues the cycle of development.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For <a href=\"/events/hacktoberfest/faq/\">Jenkins</a>, Hacktoberfest is an opportunity to collaborate with and expand the community, while learning and sharing with all experience levels.\nThese contributions are what keeps Jenkins moving forward, so having an opportunity to celebrate both the project and the people is amazing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"hacktoberfest-results\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#hacktoberfest-results\"></a>Hacktoberfest results</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>During October, the Jenkins project received 613 pull requests from 117 different contributors.\nAll of these helped to improve Jenkins, create new resources, and meet the needs of Jenkins users.\nFrom these, 531 pull requests are completed, meaning they have been merged or flagged as \"hacktoberfest-approved\".\nThey were submitted by 95 different contributors, with 42 participants qualifying for <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors\">swag</a> with Jenkins contributions alone!\nA total of 1,183 manually created pull requests were submitted during October in the jenkins-ci and jenkins-infra organizations.\nOverall, this appears to be a 10 to 15 percent increase in the average number of monthly submissions.\nWith this in mind, we want to highlight some new and returning Jenkins contributors, including their experiences and advice for other users.\nThese contributors were selected at random, as Hacktoberfest had such high levels of participation.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"new-jenkins-contributors\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#new-jenkins-contributors\"></a>New Jenkins contributors</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First, we'd like to share some insight from <a href=\"https://github.com/Jagrutiti\">Jagruti Tiwari</a>.\nJagruti is based in Mumbai, India and active in various areas of open source.\nThis immersion is the main component of her strategy to explore and learn new things.\nShe is not afraid of challenges and have received assistance from the friendly, open-source communities.\nShe is inspired by thought leaders such as Ankita Tripathi.\nJagruti's contributions to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest include documentation, code examples, and testing.\nShe has also provided reviews for other community members, which supports the open-source spirit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Next, we want to introduce <a href=\"https://github.com/OmkarBorhade98\">Omkar Borhade</a> from Pune, India.\nOmkar just started as a software engineer, after graduating as a Mechanical Engineer.\nHe is new to open source, and this was his first time participating in Hacktoberfest.\nHis goal was to become more familiar the Jenkins project.\nThis was achieved by a lot of reading, approaching issues with an open mind, and providing documentation.\nAs a new contributor, he shared that it can be difficult to understand the issue and what is needed for resolution.\nThis knowledge comes with experience, so have some patience when getting started.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2022-11-14-hacktoberfest-recap/omkar.png\" alt=\"Omkar Borhade\" width=\"20%\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/krisstern\">Kris Stern</a> is a full-stack software engineer based out of Hong Kong SAR, China.\nHe has previously trained as an observational astrophysicist with a PhD in physics, and is currently studying part-time for a master's degree in computer science.\nThis is his third Hacktoberfest, and first Hacktoberfest contributing to Jenkins.\nHe has contributed to open source previously for astronomy, but shifted focus since graduating.\nHis goals during Hacktoberfest were giving back to the Jenkins community and acquiring more software development skills along the way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

id=\"returning-jenkins-contributors\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#returning-jenkins-contributors\"></a>Returning Jenkins contributors</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jimklimov\">Jim Klimov</a> is a regular Jenkins contributor.\nJim is based in the Czech Republic, and has been working in open source for quite some time.\nHe has worked on various enterprise document workflow and messaging systems, and is currently a DevOps architect.\nHe is the creator and maintainer of several Jenkins plugins.\nAlong with his own experience, he also learned a lot from previous contributors.\nHaving this knowledge feels like standing on the shoulders of giants.\nThis is his second Hacktoberfest in Jenkins, but Jim contributes all year round.\nChallenges that have come up for Jim include maintainability expectations to get pull requests merged, and architecture becoming more costly as time goes on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/highflyer910\">Teona Mushambadze</a> is another contributor who submitted work to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.\nTeona created three new logos: <a href=\"/artwork/#turkey\">Turkey</a>, <a href=\"/artwork/#georgia\">Georgia</a>, and a <a href=\"/artwork/#nerd\">Jenkins nerd</a> themed logo.\nThese logos help connect Jenkins to users globally and extend the community even further.\nShe is a freelance developer, and this is her first time contributing to Jenkins in Hacktoberfest.\nHer motivation when starting was curiosity and learning more about open source.\nThrough her contributions, she has learned how to work with someone else's code.\nThere have been challenges when new tools are installed, but don't work as expected.\nHowever, these are learning experiences, as each one is an opportunity to understand what is causing the behavior.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2022-11-14-hacktoberfest-recap/teona.png\" alt=\"Teona Mushambadze\" width=\"20%\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/StefanSpieker\">Stefan Spieker</a> is a solutions architect and DevOps engineer from Aachen, Germany.\nHe has been participating in Hacktoberfest since 2019, with a strong focus on Jenkins core and plugin development.\nHacktoberfest was the trigger to start participating, and Stefan has continued to contribute regularly.\nStefan likes to contribute to open source in his free time and has found that there are always ways to improve.\nFor Hacktoberfest, this included updating projects that still have spotbugs disabled and adopting a plugin to become a maintainer.\nSince he uses open-source software daily, especially in his professional life, Stefan embraces this by giving back as an OSS consumer.\nHe is an advocate for others contributing to open source, and has encouraged colleagues to participate in any capacity they can.\nStefan feels that the first pull request is always toughest, due to the challenges of setting up an initial environment and meeting approval expectations of a maintainer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kaltepeter\">Kayla Altepeter</a> is a senior engineer from Minneapolis, Minnesota and has been participating in Hacktoberfest since 2018.\nDespite having less bandwidth to dedicate to this year, Kayla shared the Hacktoberfest information with her colleagues.\nThis resulted in another person contributing, which encouraged Kayla to participate in this year's event.\nOpen source is mission critical for her own fun projects and the projects built at work.\nKayla contributes to Jenkins because Jenkins is how product code is delivered.\nShe also shared that Jenkins maintainers have been responsive and helpful when it comes to creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests.\nThis collaboration is a hallmark of open source and important to the continued progress of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img

id=\"contributor-insights\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#contributor-insights\"></a>Contributor insights</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The thrill you get from knowing that countless people are using something you built is something a swag can never match.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If an issue is too hard to solve at the moment, take a break from it and try out a different one.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Jagruti Tiwari\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Contributing to open source also gives a feeling of satisfaction that the projects you are contributing to are used by several people on this planet and your contributions are benefiting them in one way or another.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When you are new, it does feel scary and confusing.\nPatience is important in the beginning.\nDon't be afraid to ask your doubts.\nFind good first issues that you are comfortable with.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Since, my all contributions for this Hacktoberfest were to Jenkins project, I would like to thank Jenkins and team to accepts my commits, guiding me in the resolution of issues and helping me to learn and grow by the means of the project.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Omkar Borhade\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For people hesitating, there is nothing to fear.\nStart with the easiest issues, and step after step it gets more fun.\nYou will notice how you grow as a developer.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Teona Mushambadze\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I think open source is important because besides its utility it is also a great way to organize knowledge and to build communities with a common set of interests or purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sometimes engaging in open source means tinkering with new tech and going at it alone.\nIt is challenging at times but also tremendously rewarding.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sometimes it is hard to get started, and it takes time and perseverance to make things work the way they are intended.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Kris Stern\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Find a project that interests you, with technologies or approaches you want to learn, go tinker, and post pull requests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In any case, you would learn more about the world, project, yourself, interactions and patience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Documentation is one area almost everyone can do better, and almost anyone can help improve.\nIt is easy to overlook something as \"apparent\" after a decade of experience with a project when it is really non-trivial for a newcomer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In case of Jenkins core, plugin or shared library contributions, keep in mind that Java IDEs like NetBeans or IDEA can be very helpful to step through the server sources with a debugger.\nPeppering code with temporary <code>printlns</code> only goes so far, sometimes you will need real tools.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Jim Klimov\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To those that hesitate: I encourage everyone to try it out.\nWe have within Jenkins a great community, which tries to help so that the PR also gets merged eventually.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Stefan Spieker\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"quoteblock\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you are afraid to contribute, find a repo with clear steps to remove that hurdle and just try to set it up locally.\nIf you can do that, you can open a pull request and someone will probably offer to help if you get stuck.\nFinding orgs that have a good chat or helpful maintainers makes it easier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Fixing a small bug that affects you is great because you know the issue.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"attribution\">\n— Kayla Altepeter\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

  "content_html": "<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The previous in-person Jenkins Contributor Summit took place in 2020, just prior to the lockdowns and precautions that would change the world.\nThankfully, on February 2, 2024, just prior to this year's FOSDEM conference, we were able to gather again, in Brussels, so that we could have an in-person Jenkins Contributor Summit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The return to in-person meant that not only could we gather in one location, but we were also able to collaborate and work together directly, something that is not normally possible due to the global spread of the Jenkins community.\nTo make things even better, all of the Jenkins Officers and four of the five board members were able to travel to Brussels for the summit!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Massive thanks to <a href=\"https://www.betacowork.com/\">Betacowork</a> for providing a space that could hold the Contributor Summit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you want to follow along, we are including a link to the <a

href=\"https://github.com/vlatombe\">Vincent Latombe</a> sharing what was done in Jenkins to support High Availability/Horizontal Scalability for CloudBees.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock

insights and review from the Platform SIG.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/2024/02/28/bruno-platform-update.jpg\" alt=\"Bruno Verachten reviews the Jenkins platform over 2023 and what the 2024 goals look like.\" width=\"839\" height=\"631\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Once Bruno finished his presentation, author:notmyfault[Alexander Brandes] and Damien Duportal shared and discussed the idea (and potential challenges) of removing Blue Ocean from the Jenkins base distribution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/2024/02/28/alex-and-damien-blue-ocean-update.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Brandes

width=\"839\" height=\"631\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The presentation itself reviewed what the API usage might include, why it is helpful to perform this search, why migrations should be managed, and why empathy is a core value when it comes to development and engineering.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Contributor Summit then concluded with a two hour group coding session, where attendees were encouraged to work with other members of the summit to work on any of the topics that were discussed prior.\nThis provided an opportunity for people to work directly with one another, which would otherwise be impossible due to how far the Jenkins community stretches.\nWork that would typically be done asynchronously was instead immediately possible thanks to the proximity of the contributors.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/post-images/2024/02/28/group-coding-session.jpg\" alt=\"The group

the rest of the weekend.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This year's FOSDEM conference was as busy as ever!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div

height=\"631\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Jenkins booth saw tons of visitors over the two days, and we even sold out most of our t-shirts!\nBruno once again brought miniJen and a whole new Kubernetes (Roundernetes) set-up to help draw visitors in and have conversations around what Jenkins is capable of.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div

width=\"839\" height=\"631\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the course of FOSDEM, we received hundreds of visitors, evident by the lack of stickers that we brought home.\nThere was very little downtime at the Jenkins stand, with visitors constantly coming by with questions about Jenkins present and future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock text-center\">\n<div

class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We want to share our deep appreciation to <a href=\"https://www.betacowork.com/\">Betacowork</a> for providing a room for the Jenkins contributor summit.\nThe room was more than enough for all of the contributors to gather and share in the summit, in addition to providing great space for the group coding session.\nThanks to Jean-Marc Meessen for connecting with Betacowork to secure the room for this year's summit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We also want to thank <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2024/\">FOSDEM</a> for once again allowing Jenkins to be part of the event.\nIt was a wonderful experience to attend the conference and share Jenkins with the open-source community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We would also like to thank both CloudBees and the Continuous Delivery Foundation for donating the shirts, socks, and stickers that occupied our booth for the weekend.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

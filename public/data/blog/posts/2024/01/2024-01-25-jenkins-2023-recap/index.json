otherwise, we publish a blog post only for the most popular ones, such as <a href=\"/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/\">Spring4Shell</a> or <a href=\"/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/\">Log4Shell</a>.\nWith dozens of CVEs published every month, we prefer not to publish information for each one unless it is relevant.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To reduce the occurrence of those issues and provide reporters with a point of reference, we have updated the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/SECURITY.md\">security policy in Docker</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We would also like to extend our gratitude to the <a href=\"https://securitylab.github.com/\">GitHub Security Lab</a> for reporting 27 vulnerabilities through their <a href=\"https://codeql.github.com/\">CodeQL</a> rules and for their collaborative efforts in both the analysis and the enhancement of our tools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The team does not rely solely on “external” security researchers to find vulnerabilities; a considerable amount of time during the year is spent on proactively auditing the code.\nThis year was marked by some specific research areas: OAuth flow and disabled SSL validation, in addition to the usual CSRF, XSS, or XXE vulnerabilities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Additionally, we have expanded the scope of our security reviews for Pull Requests, particularly in Jenkins core.\nApproximately <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Asecurity-approved\">70 PRs</a> were labeled as “security-approved”.\nThis proactive measure allowed the team to prevent the introduction of some vulnerabilities, which is significantly less costly than addressing them after they have been incorporated into the production code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As part of our mission, raising community awareness about security is also a key factor in reducing the introduction of vulnerabilities at an early stage.\nIn this regard, we welcomed Andrea to our security team for a summer internship from June to August.\nBy the end of it, he had successfully reported 28 vulnerabilities.\nFor more information about his internship, you can read <a href=\"/blog/2023/08/23/summer-internship-in-jenkins-security/\">his blog post</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Education and tooling are closely related for us.\nWe are investing time to propose new security automation and to improve our existing tooling.\nThis year, we <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/-wTosY82jZU/m/8OidfVTcAAAJ\">introduced</a> the existing CodeQL ruleset for hosting requests.\nThis provided future maintainers with detailed explanations of the findings.\nAlong with this effort, we also enhanced our security scan by <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-security-scan/pull/13\">supporting warning suppression</a> through code annotation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Continuing with tooling improvements, we <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/8Ia0OBmzF1A/m/YBdi40u3BAAJ\">added</a> a beta feature to the bot present in SECURITY tickets, allowing maintainers to block or unblock releases of their plugins.\nThe intent of this feature is to reduce the likelihood of an involuntary release when one is staged in private for a future advisory.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We also <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/EqBm9AuAm-k/m/G_YPRuYZAgAJ\">introduced</a> the possibility of having an exclusive CD mode.\nThis option allows maintainers to force all releases of their plugins to be done through the official CI, reducing the risk related to their laptops being compromised.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Nowadays, AI is everywhere.\nFor security, it’s often a bit more complicated due to the aspect of confidentiality.\nTo circumvent this while still delving into the topic, we have been using OpenAI API since October to triage the new JENKINS tickets.\nIt’s the public tracker for Jenkins, but sometimes, vulnerability reports are wrongly submitted there.\nAI has helped us detect whether something is security-related and thus expands our scope without needing to monitor everything.\nThis approach has proven to be quite successful after three months.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Along with other small projects, we continue to work on more long-term/background projects, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hr_Kaf0fVWBACibpHbSYsk4RoqcHD3cBrqXxuTtWKVM\">introduction</a> of the Content-Security-Policy header. Throughout the year, we made <a href=\"https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-71014\">significant progress</a> in covering the core usage of inline JavaScript.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"Governance\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2023/01/12/jenkins-newsletter/governance.png\" alt=\"Governance Update\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins is a project of the Continuous Delivery Foundation.\nWe’re grateful for the many different ways that the Continuous Delivery Foundation supports the Jenkins project.\nThey provide financial support for Jenkins infrastructure, promotional support for Jenkins initiatives, infrastructure support for the Jenkins issue tracker, and consultation on many other topics.\nThe Jenkins project was well represented at cdCon 2023 and at cdCon Japan.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"infrastructure\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2023/01/12/jenkins-newsletter/infrastructure.png\" alt=\"Infrastructure Update\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Contributed by: author:dduportal[Damien Duportal]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Infrastructure costs decreased by 21% in 2023 while usage increased.\nJenkins use is increasing worldwide and Jenkins infrastructure continues to meet the growing needs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins infrastructure broadened its operating environments in 2023 by expanding its use of ARM64 processors to reduce costs.\nAdditional software improvements were implemented in the Jenkins Pipeline to reduce costs while maintaining reliability.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Costs were further reduced by the Artifactory bandwidth reduction project.\nWe’ve gone from 50 TB per month to 15 TB per month of artifact repository bandwidth use, thanks to help from JFrog and implementations of artifact caching proxies by the infrastructure team.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We’re grateful for donations from our organizational sponsors like CloudBees, the Continuous Delivery Foundation, and the Linux Foundation and for our infrastructure sponsors including GitHub, JFrog, Atlassian, Microsoft, DigitalOcean, Netlify, PagerDuty, Discourse, Datadog, and Cloudflare.\nWe deeply appreciate the mirror providers around the world like Oregon State University Open Source Lab, Tsinghua University, XMission, Yamagata University, Servana, Belnet, and RWTH Aachen University.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"modern-ui\" class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2023/01/12/jenkins-newsletter/ui_ux.png\" alt=\"User Experience Update\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The badly outdated and unmaintained Prototype.js JavaScript library has been <a href=\"/blog/2023/10/09/prototype-removed/\">removed from Jenkins</a> core and from over 50 Jenkins plugins.\nSpecial thanks to author:basil[Basil Crow] and author:timja[Tim Jacomb] for their work to identify and replace Prototype.js references in Jenkins JavaScript.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>User interface look and feel improvements continued throughout 2023.\nImprovements were delivered in forms, menus, and pages. Menus are easier to navigate and easier to understand.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Multiple improvements were released for the Jenkins management pages, including the new “Appearance” page that makes it easier to use Jenkins themes.\nForms, pages, and menus have all been enhanced in 2023.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Navigation of cloud management pages is simpler and clearer thanks to layout and navigation enhancements.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Hundreds of user interface improvement pull requests have been merged this year.

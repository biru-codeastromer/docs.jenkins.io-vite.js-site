like Jenkins.\nThe existing Jenkins tutorials, while comprehensive, had become a significant barrier to entry for many developers, especially those new to continuous integration and deployment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2024/open-source-summit-europe/\">Open Source Summit Europe 2024</a>, the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) organized a <a href=\"https://cd.foundation/cd-mini-summit-vienna/\">mini summit</a>.\nThe CFP committee accepted our presentation on the Jenkins tutorials modernization project, which was completed during Google Summer of Code 2023.\nThis initiative was presented alongside <a href=\"https://cd.foundation/cd-mini-summit-vienna/program/\">other valuable contributions</a> from various CDF projects.\nWe are grateful to the <a href=\"https://cd.foundation\">CDF</a> for providing this platform to share our work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This blog post accompanies that presentation and details our systematic approach to redesigning the Jenkins tutorials.\nWe'll examine how we transformed complex setup procedures into streamlined, accessible guides using modern tooling and best practices.\nThe discussion will cover the challenges we encountered, the technical solutions we implemented, and the measurable improvements achieved through these changes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"the-problem-old-jenkins-tutorials\"><a class=\"anchor\"

href=\"#a-visual-comparison\"></a>A visual comparison</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Before we dive into the specifics, let's take a visual journey through the old and new tutorial experiences:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"839\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVOpNnOXr_s?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Did you notice how much scrolling was required on the right side?\nIt was like a never-ending story.\nAnd did you see the amount of code users had to copy-paste?\nWhile we'll always need a certain quantity of code for the Jenkins pipeline itself, the setup process should be as simple as possible.\nThat wasn't the case with the old tutorials.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"breaking-down-the-issues\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#breaking-down-the-issues\"></a>Breaking down the issues</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our old tutorials, while comprehensive, presented several significant challenges:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Overwhelming complexity</strong>: Users were bombarded with Docker commands before they could even start learning about Jenkins.\nThe tutorial assumed users were Docker gurus, throwing commands at them like there's no tomorrow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Assumptions about user knowledge</strong>: The tutorials assumed a high level of Docker expertise.\nBut let me ask you this: how many of you knew Docker really well the first time you tried Jenkins?\nThat's not a fair expectation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lengthy setup process</strong>: A significant portion of the tutorial was dedicated to setup rather than learning Jenkins itself.\nWe were spending more time with Docker than with Jenkins!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reliance on outdated tools</strong>: We were heavily dependent on the deprecated Blue Ocean plugin, which was no longer recommended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Docker in Docker</strong>: The old tutorial used Docker in Docker, which is considered a bad practice from a security standpoint.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lack of context</strong>: The tutorials often lacked explanations for why certain steps were necessary, leaving users to blindly follow instructions without understanding.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here's a snippet from the old Maven tutorial to illustrate these points:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-bash\" data-lang=\"bash\">docker network create jenkins\ndocker run \\\n  --name jenkins-docker \\\n  --rm \\\n  --detach \\\n  --privileged \\\n  --network jenkins \\\n  --network-alias docker \\\n  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \\\n  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \\\n  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \\\n  --publish 2376:2376 \\\n  docker:dind \\\n  --storage-driver overlay2</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This command, while functional, is overwhelming for beginners and lacks context.\nWhy do we need a Docker network?\nWhy are we running Docker in Docker?\nThese questions were left unanswered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"the-solution-revamping-with-docker-compose\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-solution-revamping-with-docker-compose\"></a>The Solution: Revamping with Docker Compose</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After much deliberation and feedback, we decided to leverage <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/compose-application-model/\">Docker Compose</a> to simplify the entire setup process.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"why-docker-compose\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-docker-compose\"></a>Why Docker Compose?</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Docker Compose can encapsulate complex multi-container setups into a single, easy-to-understand file.\nIt is the only tool that can handle the complexity of the Jenkins controller and agent setup while making it accessible to newcomers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here's an example of how Docker Compose simplifies things:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"listingblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\">services:\n  jenkins:\n    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts\n    ports:\n      - \"8080:8080\"\n    volumes:\n      - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home\n  agent:\n    image: jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk17\n    environment:\n      - JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=<your_public_key>\nvolumes:\n  jenkins_home:</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With this setup, users can start Jenkins and an agent with a single command: <code>docker compose up -d</code>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"key-improvements\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#key-improvements\"></a>Key improvements</h3>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplified setup</strong>: Instead of a series of complex Docker commands, users can now get started with a single Docker Compose command.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reduced assumptions</strong>: By encapsulating the setup in Docker Compose, we removed the need for extensive Docker knowledge.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Focus on Jenkins</strong>: With a streamlined setup, users can dive into learning Jenkins faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Modernized tools</strong>: We replaced outdated plugins like Blue Ocean with more current solutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Elimination of Docker in Docker</strong>: Our new setup avoids this security risk entirely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Contextual guidance</strong>: We've added explanations for each step, helping users understand why they're performing certain actions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"the-process-collaboration-and-innovation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-process-collaboration-and-innovation\"></a>The Process: Collaboration and innovation</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This revamp was a collaborative effort, with significant contributions from our Google Summer of Code participant, author:ash-sxn[Ashutosh Saxena].\nHis fresh perspective as a newcomer to Jenkins was invaluable in identifying pain points that we, as experienced developers, had overlooked.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"key-innovations\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#key-innovations\"></a>Key innovations</h3>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-architecture support</strong>: We ensured our Docker images work on both <code>x86_64</code> and <code>ARM64</code> architectures.\nThis was a significant challenge that Ashutosh tackled using Docker's <code>buildx</code> tool.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GitPod integration</strong>: We made Jenkins accessible directly from the browser, reducing hardware barriers to entry.\nThis was particularly important for users with less powerful machines or those in environments with limited resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Docker Compose profiles</strong>: We introduced profiles for different languages and technologies, making it easy to switch between setups.\nFor example, users can start a Maven-specific setup with <code>docker compose --profile maven up -d</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automated updates</strong>: We implemented automation to keep our Docker images up-to-date, using tools like <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot\">Dependabot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.updatecli.io/\">UpdateCLI</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div

class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The outcome of our efforts is a Jenkins experience that's more inclusive than ever.\nLet's break down the key improvements:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"1-simplified-setup\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-simplified-setup\"></a>1. Simplified setup</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Users can now get Jenkins running with a single command. Here's how straightforward it is:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p>Clone the repository: <code>git clone <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials.git\" class=\"bare\">https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials.git</a></code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Navigate to the directory: <code>cd quickstart-tutorials</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Start Jenkins: <code>docker compose --profile <tutorial_name> up -d</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>That's it! No more complex Docker commands or manual configuration.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"2-browser-based-access-with-gitpod\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-browser-based-access-with-gitpod\"></a>2. Browser-based access with GitPod</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Thanks to GitPod integration, Jenkins is now just a click away, even on less powerful devices.\nThis cloud-based approach brings several key advantages for accessibility and ease of use:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"olist arabic\">\n<ol class=\"arabic\">\n<li>\n<p><em>*One-Click Setup*</em>: The repository's <code>README</code> contains a <a href=\"https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials\">GitPod link</a> that launches Jenkins instantly.\nWith the GitPod Chrome extension installed, you'll see a prominent green button that makes the process even smoother.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>*Resource-Friendly*</em>: GitPod provides 50 hours of free monthly usage, making Jenkins accessible to users regardless of their local hardware capabilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>*Bandwidth Optimization*</em>: Since GitPod handles the heavy lifting of downloading Docker images, users can get started quickly even with limited internet connectivity - whether they're working from a train, a remote location, or a region with restricted bandwidth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>*Familiar Development Environment*</em>: Users get instant access to a Visual Studio Code-like IDE and terminal, complete with clear instructions for their chosen tutorial.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Here's a quick demonstration of the GitPod integration in action:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"839\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsH7yL5chow?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As you can see, users have some instructions and a command to copy-paste in the terminal.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After pasting the command in the terminal, the setup process begins automatically.\nDocker images are pulled efficiently through GitPod's infrastructure, preserving your local bandwidth.\nThe Jenkins controller and agent containers are launched, and a browser tab automatically opens to display the Jenkins interface.\nThe entire process takes less than a minute - a significant improvement over traditional setup methods.\nSince we've streamlined the authentication process, you can log in immediately using the credentials (<code>admin</code>/<code>admin</code>) and begin your Jenkins journey.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"839\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEcreaxR6MQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Expanding the window reveals the full Jenkins interface.\nUpon logging in with the tutorial credentials (<code>admin</code>/<code>admin</code>), you'll immediately notice several key features: a pre-configured job and an active agent visible in the left sidebar.\nThis job, while simple, serves an important purpose — it demonstrates that both your Jenkins controller is operational and the agent is properly connected.\nNavigating to \"<em>`Manage Jenkins`</em>\" shows that all plugins are current, eliminating any need for initial administrative setup.\nThe bottom right corner displays the current Jenkins LTS version (<code>2.462.2</code> at the time of recording), confirming you're working with the latest stable release.\nThis streamlined environment allows users to focus entirely on learning Jenkins, without getting caught up in configuration details.\nThe entire setup process, from start to finish, takes less than two minutes and requires no local installation — perfectly aligned with our goal of making Jenkins more accessible to everyone.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"videoblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<iframe width=\"839\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEaWpCm1xLU?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The GitPod terminal output illustrates another key innovation: our implementation of Docker Compose profiles for various programming languages and technologies.\nThis feature exemplifies our commitment to simplicity — switching between different technology stacks, whether Maven, Python, or Node.js, requires only a single command: <code>docker compose --profile maven up -d</code>.\nThe system handles all the complexity behind the scenes, delivering a seamless experience that lets developers focus on learning Jenkins rather than wrestling with configuration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This streamlined approach reflects our broader commitment to inclusivity.\nThrough multi-architecture support and browser-based accessibility via GitPod, we've created an environment where developers of all experience levels and technical resources can engage with Jenkins effectively.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"3-flexible-configurations\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-flexible-configurations\"></a>3. Flexible configurations</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Docker Compose profiles allow easy switching between different tech stacks.\nWhether you're working with Maven, Python, or Node.js, you can start the appropriate environment with a simple profile switch.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"4-up-to-date-and-secure\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-up-to-date-and-secure\"></a>4.

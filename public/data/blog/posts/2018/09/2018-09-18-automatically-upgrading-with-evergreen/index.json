  "content_html": "<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When I first <a href=\"/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/\">wrote about Jenkins\nEvergreen</a>, which was then referred to as \"Jenkins Essentials\", I mentioned a\nnumber of future developments which in the subsequent months have become\n<em>reality</em>. At this year's DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco, I will\nbe sharing more details on the philosophy behind Jenkins Evergreen, show off\nhow far we have come, and discuss where we're going with this radical\ndistribution of Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><span class=\"image right center\"><img src=\"/images/logos/magician/256.png\" alt=\"Jenkins Evergreen\"></span></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As discussed in my first blog post, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300\">JEP-300</a>,\nthe first two pillars of Jenkins Evergreen have been the primary focus of our\nefforts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"automatically-updated-distribution\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#automatically-updated-distribution\"></a>Automatically Updated Distribution</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, implementing the mechanisms necessary for safely and\nautomatically updating a Jenkins distribution, which includes core and plugins,\nwas and continues to be a sizable amount of work. In\n<a href=\"/blog/2018/09/13/speaker-blog-evergreen-safely-upgrading/\">Baptiste's talk</a>\nhe will be speaking about the details which make Evergreen \"go\" whereas\nI will be speaking about <em>why</em> an automatically updating distribution is\nimportant.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As continuous integration and continuous delivery have become more commonplace,\nand fundamental to modern software engineering, Jenkins tends to live two\ndifferent lifestyles depending on the organization. In some organizations,\nJenkins is managed and deployed methodically with automation tools like Chef,\nPuppet, etc. In many other organizations however, Jenkins is treated much more\nlike an <em>appliance</em>, not unlike the office wireless router. Installed and so\nlong as it continues to do its job, people won't think about it too much.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins Evergreen's distribution makes the \"Jenkins as an Appliance\" model much\nbetter for everybody by ensuring the latest feature updates, bug and security\nfixes are always installed in Jenkins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Additionally, I believe Evergreen will serve another group we don't adequately\nserve at the moment: those who want Jenkins to behave much more like a\n<em>service</em>. We typically don't consider \"versions\" of GitHub.com, we receive\nincremental updates to the site and realize the benefits of GitHub's on-going\ndevelopment without ever thinking about an \"upgrade.\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I believe Jenkins Evergreen can, and will provide that same experience.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"automatic-sane-defaults\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#automatic-sane-defaults\"></a>Automatic Sane Defaults</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The really powerful thing about Jenkins as a platform is the broad variety of\npatterns and practices different organizations may adopt. For newer users, or\nusers with common use-cases, that significant amount of flexibility can result\nin a paradox of choice. With Jenkins Evergreen, much of the most common\nconfiguration is automatically configured out of the box.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Included is Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean, by default. We also removed some\nlegacy functionalities from Jenkins while we were at it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are also utilizing some of the fantastic\n<a href=\"/projects/jcasc/\">Configuration as Code</a>\nwork, which recently had its 1.0 release, to automatically set sane defaults in\nJenkins Evergreen.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"status-quo\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#status-quo\"></a>Status Quo</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The effort has made significant strides thus far this year, and we're really\nexcited for people to start trying out Jenkins Evergreen. As of today,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/c0ba3cab7a7dfe398ec411d3271922bb98f04f8e/content/projects/evergreen/index.adoc\">Jenkins Evergreen</a>\nis ready for <em>early adopters</em>. We <strong>do not</strong> yet recommend using Jenkins\nEvergreen for a production environment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you're at DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco please come see\n<a href=\"https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/F9Nn/safely-upgrading-jenkins-every-single-day\">Baptiste's talk</a> Wednesday at 3:45pm in Golden Gate Ballroom A.

The governance board has also met and there will be more information coming regarding removal of offensive terminology.\nLast week we took another step towards removing offensive terminology within the project by updating previous blog posts and <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/3447\">removing offensive terminology in old blogs</a>, cleaning up some references in Jenkins built-in documentation and localization, etc.\nThe meeting minutes are available <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5dTSqe56chFhDSGNfg_MCy-LmseUs_S3ys_tg60sTs/edit\">here</a> and a recording of the meeting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGZ1CvkmZXU\">here</a>\nThere is more <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/CLR55wMZwZ8\">work to do</a>. The core team is working to address terms such as \"Master\", \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" as well addressing git branching terminology.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We could use <a href=\"/participate/\">your help</a>\nWe continue to do this much needed work and would like to remind everyone that the Jenkins project is governed by the <a href=\"/project/conduct/\">Code of Conduct.</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Sincerely,\nMarky Jackson</p>\n</div>"

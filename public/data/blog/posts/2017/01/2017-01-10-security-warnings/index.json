But what does that mean?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the past, we&#8217;ve notified users about security issues in Jenkins and in\nplugins through various means: Emails to the\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories\">jenkinsci-advisories mailing list</a>\n(which I recommend you subscribe to), blog posts, and, recently, emails to the\noss-security mailing list.  But I still wanted to increase the reach of our\nnotifications, to make sure Jenkins admins are informed quickly about possible\nsecurity problems on their instances.  The logical next step was to include\nthese notifications in Jenkins itself, and that feature has been added in\nJenkins 2.40.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Today we enabled the publication of warnings on our update sites: Once Jenkins\n2.40 (or newer) refreshes its cache of update site metadata, it may now inform\nyou that you&#8217;re using a vulnerable plugin that should be updated or removed.\nRight now, these aren&#8217;t previously unknown warnings, but reference security\nadvisories for plugin vulnerabilities that have been published over the past few\nyears.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We will of course continue to publish security advisories using the mailing\nlist of the same name, as well other means.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Stay safe!</p>\n</div>"

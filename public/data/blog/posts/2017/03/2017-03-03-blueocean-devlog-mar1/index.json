But also questions\nfrom people starting to extend, or add features, to Blue Ocean, which is very\nnice to see.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/halkeye\">Gavin Mogan</a> has been looking at integrating\nthe plugin:sauce-ondemand[Sauce OnDemand] plugin into Blue Ocean for better\nbrowser-test reporting. Tangentially related, we also are planning to improve\nbrowser-testing in Blue Ocean as well. What is perhaps more exciting is that\nmore people, like <a href=\"https://github.com/dragoonis\">Paul Dragoonis</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/m4dc4p\">other folks</a>, are starting to contribute some\nfixes which have been lingering around for a while.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Up Next:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Round trip Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor changes with load/save</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bundling the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor with the \"aggregator\" Blue Ocean\nplugin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some release candidates!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n</div>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping to make Blue Ocean a great user experience for\nJenkins, please join the Blue Ocean development team on\n<a href=\"https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_blueocean-plugin:gitter.im\">Gitter</a>!</p>\n</div>"

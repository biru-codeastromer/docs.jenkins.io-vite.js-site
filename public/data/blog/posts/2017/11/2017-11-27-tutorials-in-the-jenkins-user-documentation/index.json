  "content_html": "<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Regular perusers of the <a href=\"/doc\">Jenkins User Documentation</a> may have noticed\nthe presence of the <strong>Tutorials</strong> part (between the <strong>Guided Tour</strong> and <strong>User\nHandbook</strong>) that appeared in the last couple of months and gradually began to get\npopulated with much of my recent work, writing Jenkins tutorials.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>My name's Giles and I've been a technical writer in the software development\nfield for several years now. I've always been passionate about technical writing\nand more recently, the technologies that go into developing written content and\nautomating its generation - like Jenkins! I was a former Atlassian and recently\njoined CloudBees as a Senior Technical Writer, working remotely from the \"Sydney\nOffice\", with my current focus on the Jenkins User Documentation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"why-tutorials\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-tutorials\"></a>Why tutorials?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>My exposure to Jenkins and its usage over the years has been patchy at best.\nDuring this time, however, I've had some degree of experience as a user of\nvarious continuous delivery (CD) tools like Jenkins and am reasonably familiar\nwith the advantages these tools can offer software development teams.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I've also found that while many software developers are familiar with the\nbroader concept of \"developer operations\" (or simply \"devops\"), fewer seem\nfamiliar with the concepts of CD and related tools to facilitate devops within\norganizations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The CD process is based on the fundamental flow of <strong>building the application</strong> >\n<strong>testing it</strong> > <strong>delivering it</strong>, where typically:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>building</strong> part involves compiling the application and/or ensuring all\nnecessary libraries and dependencies are in place for the application to run\nas intended.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>testing</strong> part involves testing the built application with automated tests\nto ensure that changes implemented by developers function as expected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>delivering</strong> part involves packaging or presenting the application in a\nway that can be delivered to customers or other users for any kind of purpose.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Now, as one of the major contributors to the Jenkins User Documentation (and\nfaced with a reasonably steep learning curve), it quickly became apparent about\nthe lack of accessible documentation to hand-hold people relatively new to\nJenkins through this CD process. I couldn't find anything in the Jenkins User\nDocumentation to demonstrate how Jenkins implements this process on a simple\napp that delivers an end result.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>With the guidance and assistance of helpful colleagues, I therefore decided to\nembark on creating a series of Jenkins tutorials to help fill these\ndocumentation and knowledge gaps. These tutorials are based on Daniele Procida's\ndescription of how tutorials should be presented in his blog post\n\"<a href=\"https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/\">What nobody tells you about\ndocumentation</a>\").</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"introductory-tutorials\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#introductory-tutorials\"></a>Introductory tutorials</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The first set of tutorials on the <a href=\"/doc/tutorials\">Tutorials overview</a> page\ndemonstrate how to implement this fundamental CD process in Jenkins on a simple\napplication for a given technology stack.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>So far, there's one for\n<a href=\"/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/\">Java with Maven</a> and another\nfor <a href=\"/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/\">Node.js and\nReact with npm</a>. Another for Python will be added to this list in the near\nfuture.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>These tutorials define your application's entire CD process (i.e. your Pipeline)\nin a <code>Jenkinsfile</code>, whose Groovy-like Declarative Pipeline syntax is checked in\nto your Git source repository. Managing your Pipeline with your application's\nsource code like this forms the fundamentals of \"Pipeline as code\".</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <strong>Introductory tutorials</strong> also cover how to use some powerful features of\nJenkins, like <a href=\"/doc/tutorials/create-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean/\">Blue Ocean</a>,\nwhich makes it easy to connect to an existing cloud, web or locally hosted Git\nrepository and create your Pipeline with limited knowledge of Pipeline syntax.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"advanced-tutorials\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#advanced-tutorials\"></a>Advanced tutorials</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also soon to be released will be the first <strong>Advanced tutorial</strong> on building\nmultibranch Pipelines in Jenkins. This tutorial takes the \"Pipeline as code\"\nconcept to a new level, where a single <code>Jenkinsfile</code> (defining the entire CD\nprocess across all branches of your application's Git repository) consists of\nmultiple stages which are selectively executed based on the branch that Jenkins\nis building.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Additional tutorials that demonstrate more advanced features of Jenkins and how\nto manage your Pipelines with greater sophistication and flexibility will be\nadded to this section in future.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"summing-up\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#summing-up\"></a>Summing up</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You can access all currently available tutorials from the\n<a href=\"/doc/tutorials\">Tutorials overview</a> page in the Jenkins User Documentation.\nIt's worthwhile checking that page from time to time as it'll be updated\nwhenever a new tutorial is published.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also, if you have any suggestions for tutorials or other content you'd like to\nsee in the documentation, please post your suggestions in the\n<a href=\"https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkins/docs:matrix.org\">jenkinsci/docs gitter channel</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph boxshadow\">\n<p><span class=\"image center\"><img src=\"/images/post-images/2017-11/sydney-office-team.jpg\" alt=\"The \"Sydney Office\" team\" width=\"80%\"></span><br>\n<em>The Sydney Office team meeting at Carriageworks - from left to right, Giles\nGaskell, Nicholae Pascu, Michael Neale and James Dumay</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

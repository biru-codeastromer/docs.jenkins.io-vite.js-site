It's been a great year for Declarative\nand Pipeline in general, with the release of Declarative Pipeline 1.0 in\nFebruary, multiple releases since then, the introduction of\n<a href=\"/doc/book/pipeline/\">documentation on Pipeline at jenkins.io</a>,\nwith a focus on Declarative, and more. Given everything that's happened over\nthe last year, we thought it'd be good to let you all know what you can expect\nto see and hear about Declarative Pipeline at this year's Jenkins World.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First, on Thursday, August 31, I'll be giving a talk on Declarative Pipeline\nwith <a href=\"https://github.com/rsandell\">Robert Sandell</a>, one of my coworkers\nhere at CloudBees and another author of Declarative Pipeline. We'll be\ncovering what's happened with Declarative over the last year, new features\nadded since the 1.0 release, such as the <code>libraries</code> directive and more <code>when</code>\nconditions, what's planned for the upcoming 1.2 release (which is planned for\nshortly after Jenkins World!), including parallel <code>stage</code>s, and what's on the\nroadmap for the future. In addition, we'll be demoing some of the features in\n1.2, and providing some pointers on best practices for writing your Declarative\nPipeline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Also on Thursday, <a href=\"https://github.com/stephendonner\">Stephen Donner from Mozilla</a>\nwill be giving a demo showing Mozilla's usage of Declarative Pipeline and\nshared libraries at the Community Booth - Mozilla has been doing great work\nwith Declarative, and I'm excited to see their usage in more detail and hear\nStephen talk about their experience!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition, Robert, Stephen, and myself will all be at Jenkins World both days\nof the main sessions, and Robert and myself will also be at the\n<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/241213280/\">Contributor Summit</a>\non Tuesday. We'd love to hear your thoughts on Declarative and will be happy to\nanswer any questions that we can. Looking forward to seeing you all!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock warning\">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<i class=\"fa icon-warning\" title=\"Warning\"></i>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Andrew Bayer and Robert Sandell will be talking about the latest on\n<a href=\"https://jenkinsworld20162017.sched.com/event/ALOd/declarative-pipelines-in-jenkins\">Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins</a>\n at <a href=\"https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home\">Jenkins World</a> in August,\nregister with the code <code>JWFOSS</code> for a 30% discount off your pass.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>"

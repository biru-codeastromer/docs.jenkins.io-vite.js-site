It was an experiment to let\nplugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main\nJava Virtual Machine runtime with help of <a href=\"https://www.jruby.org/\">JRuby</a>.\nA similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with <a href=\"https://www.jython.org/\">Jython</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Over the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the\nplugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.\nIn addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.\nSpecifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins\ncore developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and\nprocesses to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.\nExamples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.\nThere was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .\n<a href=\"/blog/authors/daniel-beck/\">Daniel Beck</a> created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.\nOver the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,\nand hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation\n(<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/Ve0fqAud3Mk/m/lVejhAjNAQAJ\">discussion</a>).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>One month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the <a href=\"https://updates.jenkins.io/\">default Jenkins update center</a> will stop distributing\nthe plugin:ruby-runtime[Ruby runtime plugin], the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/ruby-runtime/#dependencies\">plugins</a> that use the Ruby runtime, the plugin:python-wrapper[Python runtime plugin], and the <a href=\"https://plugins.jenkins.io/python-wrapper/#dependencies\">plugin</a> that uses the Python runtime.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-you\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-does-this-mean-for-you\"></a>What does this mean for you?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The\nonly change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay\ninstalled, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading\nreleases or using custom update centers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Jenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.\nIt includes but is not limited to the official <a

required.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.\nPlease plan your transition away from these plugins.\nThey will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"affected-plugins\"><a class=\"anchor\"

thank all contributors and maintainers who contributed to the Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.\nWe also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.\nThese contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years\nand it is not taken for granted.\nNow we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.\nWe invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"my-instance-is-affected-what-to-do-next\"><a class=\"anchor\"

the recommendation is to remove them.\nOtherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Not all plugins have alternatives.\nAt the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.\nIf you depend on the functionality,\nwe recommend reaching out to the community in the <a href=\"/mailing-lists/\">developer mailing list</a> so that\nyou can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"
